# Changelog

## [1.3.1] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Update the last successful connection timestamp on the first successful contact and after connectivity recovers. Successful polls keep the timestamp stable, avoiding repeated Activity/Logbook state changes while other diagnostic sensors continue to update.
- Cover repeated successful polls and recovery after returned offline data or a failed coordinator refresh.

### Documentation

- Clarify that the connection timestamp records connection transitions rather than each health poll.
